# travelgram
**An Instagram geolocation photo discovery web app**

TravelGram takes the latitude/longitude of a location in the world, and pulls in geolocated photos from Instagram on a gallery. Google Maps markers are also dropped on a map according to the latitude/longitude of where each individual photo was taken.

• Javascript Event Listeners to Highlight Map Location Markers on Photo Hover (vice versa)
• Dynamic DOM Manipulation with Javascript
• Dynamic Responsive Positioning with Flexbox
• Dynamic Responsive Positioning Bootstrap 3
• Responsive Design with Media Queries


**Built Upon the following technologies:**
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3
- Sass and Jade
- AJAX
- Google Maps API
- Google Places API
- Instagram API

*This is an ongoing project. Major functionality that still needs to be built out:
- Functionality of search field in fixed navbar  (currenlty only visual presence)
- Filtering of results (currenlty only visual presence)
- Discovery Tiles do not generate Maps nor Istagram AJAX call
- Making new location search does not clear past results
