####Summary
Travelgram is an Instagram geolocation photo discovery app.

TravelGram takes the latitude/longitude of a location in the world, and pulls in geolocated photos from Instagram. Google Maps markers are also dropped on a map according to the latitude/longitude of where each individual photo was taken. Hovering over each photo will highlight the corresponding marker to show you where the photo was taken (and vice versa).

Discover the world through instagram.

####About
Travelgram was my first project for [Orange County Code School](https://www.orangecountycodeschool.com) and demonstrates:

- Javascript Event Listeners to Highlight Map Location Markers on Photo Hover (vice versa)
- Dynamic DOM Manipulation with Javascript
- Dynamic Responsive Positioning with Flexbox
- Dynamic Responsive Positioning Bootstrap 3
- Responsive Design with Media Queries
- CSS3 Transitions for Interactivity


####Travelgram is built Upon the following technologies:
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3
- Sass and Jade
- AJAX
- Google Maps API
- Google Places Search-Box Autocomplete API
- Instagram API

*This is an ongoing project. Major functionality that still needs to be built out:
- Functionality of search field in fixed navbar  (currenlty only visual presence)
- Filtering of results (currenlty only visual presence)
- Discovery Tiles do not generate Maps nor Istagram AJAX call
- Making new location search does not clear past results
